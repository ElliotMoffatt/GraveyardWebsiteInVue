                Margaret Lewsbe Abbot was the daughter of James & Sarah Abbot, born 22 Dec 1795 and baptised at Gulliford in Jan 17th 1796 and also at Lympstone Parish Church 27th July 1823 (due to marriages having to be conducted in a C of E church). John was from Kelsale, Suffolk, roughly nine years older than Margaret, John worked as a farm labourer and as a bailiff on the Drake estate whilst living in Woodbury parish. They had children Sarah in 1826 & Thomas in 1830. John died in Dec 24th 1857 aged 71, in Lympstone. Margaret in 1861 is supporting herself as a dressmaker, with Sarah and a grand-daughter Elizabeth. By the 1871 census, Margaret & Sarah are at Myrtles Cottage, The Strand, Lympstone, this time Margaret is running the property as a lodging house and Sarah is working as a school mistress in a ladies school. Margaret died in Feb 13th 1879, aged 83, in Prospect Place, Lympstone (near the brook on The Strand). Buried together the grave & headstone are at the back on the right hand wall.

Robert & Margaret were from Lympstone parish. James Abbott of Lympstone who was married to Sarah left a will in Nov 1827, mentioning his job to the monarch, shirt buttons & a ring with the portrait on King Charles in it. Sadly we don't know the relation to the family for Elizabeth.

Majesty George the third, who departed this life Nov 19 1822 in the year 79 of her age". Why was James not buried with Sarah? Sharing the grave is John Henry Burniston, who died aged 5 years in July 9th 1824. Charlotte Lewsbe Abbot of Woodbury had married John Burniston of London, late servant to the right Honourable Lord Heath deceased, in 1813, so it's fair to say that young John was Sarah's grandson. John Burniston sen is mentioned as owning the Spirit Cellar in 1822 & 1823.

                <h3>Margaret Baring & Charles Baring <small>(24)</small></h3>
                Charles Baring was the son of German Johann Baring and his wife Elizabeth Vowler, a successful business couple who wealth enabled them to purchase Larksbeare House (register office), Exeter.  Johann, having changed his name to John taught the value of good business man ship to his eldest sons John and Francis, but sadly Charles's father died when Charles was only six years old. Nothing much is known about Charles's younger life, however he marries in September 1767 to Margaret Gould at the Gould estate at Lew Trenchard. Margaret was born around 1743, possibility just a year younger than Charles. Margaret was the daughter of William Drake Gould. Charles and Margaret settle at Courtlands, Withycombe, on the Lympstone boundary. A house set in grounds sweeping down to the bank of the River Exe, with a Ladies Walk a mile long, giving views to the hills beyond. Charles develops the house into an elegant mansion, in line with his social standing.  The couple start attending Gulliford Chapel, a non-conformist meeting house, north of Lympstone travelling by carriage, the Baring donating a barrel organ for the chapel. Charles and Margaret have nine children, whilst Charles endeavours to support the family working as a merchant. It is at this stage that things start to go wrong, whether through bad judgement or bad luck, the mistakes pile up. Charles goes into business with a fulling mill at Exwick, this folds, partnership in the Devonshire Bank which goes into bankruptcy, the list goes on and on. His brothers John and Francis "regularly rescued Charles from ruin and thus preserve the family good name being scandalized by Charles's almost monstrous management". John and Francis go into business together creating Baring Brothers & Co of London, without Charles. But Charles's spending on Courtland and bad financial deals, are greatly out striping his resources. Devon Gardens Trust, 2013 reads "Charles jr to his uncle, Sir Francis, in 1807 requested the family be allowed to stay on. His mother was &hellip; very desirous to be able to retain this place &hellip;.. if we could by any means do so." It wasn't to be. In an age prior to the census, we not know the address of where the family took refuge. Margaret dies in Oct 1812, with Charles dying aged 87 in 1829. I ordered Charles's will of April that year, expecting to be charged for the service, but the will was so short, no fee was demanded. Charles address was not forth coming just stating that daughter Emily, was left to sort the probate out. Margaret and Charles are buried at Gulliford. A plaque records their names, newly restored with Heritage Lottery Funding, the plaque has been mounted on the boundary wall near to where we believe their vault is. Charles and Margaret's son William in order to inherit the Lew Trenchard estate has to change his name to Baring-Gould, William marries Diana Sabine and it is through her that "Who Do You Think You Are ?" follows the royal line through. Charles's great grandson is Rev Sabine Baring-Gould and Charles's 5 x great grandson is the comedian Josh Widdicombe & 6 x great uncle to Princess Diana.

                <h3>William Clarke & Elizabeth Clarke <small>(25)</small></h3>
                "Here lyth the body William son of William Clarke and grandchildren of Richard Clarke also of Elizabeth relict of the above, the child and daughter Thomas Smith esq of City of Exeter who died 22nd Dec 1782 aged 61". The inscription is missing sections. This tomb lies in front of the 2nd chapel, built on land given by Rev (?) Thomas Clarke in 1777 on a 300 year lease. Thomas appears to have died without issue mentioned in his will. This family lived prior to modern documents ie death certificates & census, so piecing their story together may come with mistakes. Thomas Clarke born 1708 in Topsham & William Clarke born 1710 also in Topsham both had parents Richard & Anne. In 1737 Thomas Clarke of Woodbury is mentioned as a husbandman, thence he would have had the land at Gulliford which is in Woodbury. Thomas was a pupil of Dr Doddridge in 1773 in Lympstone plus an assistant to Rev Jervis. Thomas married Grace Hancock, daughter of Rev Eliezer Hancock minister of Gulliford for 28 years. He married his second wife Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Thomas Smith sen (also buried at Gulliford) in 1767. In Thomas's will, written in 1759, it still mentions wife, Grace Clarke and also brother, Richard. Thomas died in 1778. In Elizabeth's will read in 1783, she leaves &pound;20 to Rev Jervis and leaves instructions to be buried with her husband at Gulliford.

Records show a Sarah Robinson born/ bapt 1st Feb 1803 at Bethnal Green / Cripplegate non-conformist chapel, to parents Isaac & Sarah (nee Lacy). Isaac was part of the Royal Society of London and of the Elder Brethen of the Trinity House. Sarah's low lying tomb is to the left of the path towards the rear, largely rebuilt in 2020.

                <h3>Thomas Smith Plaque <small>(27)</small></h3>
                Thomas was born circa 1800 to parents Thomas & Dorothy Smith, we know very little of Thomas's younger days. Thomas may have had a first wife (name unknown) as in the Pall Mall Gazette 2 May 1867 "Marriage &hellip; Thomas Walrond Smith eldest son of the late Capt T. Smith RN of Lympstone". Earlier in Trewman's Exeter Flying Post Feb 21st 1856 "Feb 13 at Woodbury by Rev Lovebond Fulford assisted by the Rev George Porter rector of Lympstone Capt Smith RN to Eliza fourth daughter of the late Thomas Stodgon & niece of the late Capt Sexpitch". Thomas a captain in the Royal Navy of Lympstone died Mar 8th 1863 of senile gangrene which he had suffered for 2 months. In his will his effects are under &pound;4,000. The plaque may well have been originally placed on the side of the demolished chapel and then spent most of the 20th century laid on top of Sarah Robinson's tomb, next to his parents. The plaque decorated with a stone family crest by Faulkner, Exeter, had space for other family members but this was not taken up. The plaque has now been mounted on the boundary wall at the back on the left, safe from frost in an upright position.

                Father Thomas, a gentleman married Dorothy Walrond on 16th Feb 1797 in Lympstone, they lived in what is now called Queen Anne House (next to the railway) in The Strand. They had 3 children Emlin in 1798, Thomas 1800 & Anna 1801. We know that Emlin & Anna were baptised at Gulliford. Thomas sen died Jan 13th 1826, leaving a will in which property in Lympstone & Topsham are left to his wife, after which if Dorothy dies the estate is left to son Thomas, who had to pay three hundred pounds plus additional property to his two sisters. In the 1841 census Dorothy is living with Anna, plus Sarah Walrond (aged 65 maybe a sister?) also Emily Bolt aged circa 15 (servant?). Unmarried Emlin had earlier died in Sept 1832. Then Dorothy also died in 1844 aged 81. The 1851 census show Anna now living with the Newbury family, a family of bootmakers and not in the same social class as the family originated from however Anna is listed as insane, lodging at the same address is Miss Sarah Walrond aged 77, born Lympstone. Anna dies in 1857 aged 55 and finally Thomas jr died in 1863, aged 63. The low tomb by the end of the 20th century was in a very sad way, the stone slab on top broken in two, the bricks largely missing with ivy spilling out. In 2020 Lottery money was awarded to repair the tomb.

                Mellony was the daughter of James, a woollen merchant & Anna (nee Chappple) born Sept 17th 1789 and baptised at Bow Meetings House, Exeter (Presbyterian) on Oct 9th 1789. Mellony was one of at least 7 children. On the 1841 census Mellony is down as Malone, living with her mother Anna and Sister Anna in Dawlish. By 1851, Mellony is lodging in Westbury on Trym, Glouc. without family members, as an independent gentlewoman. Then in 1861, Mellony is back in Exeter, living at no. 45 Magdalen Street again as a lodger. The next entrance on the 1861 census after Mellony's is for a Kate Chapple, whether this people is related is unknown. Mellony died 4th April 1866 in Magdalen Street and although the Exeter Dissenters Graveyard is very nearby, by this time the graveyard was full. Mellony left a very full will with lots of detail, plus a codicil, leaving property and items, with the estate under &pound;5,000. Mellony seems to have been comfort in life, not flash, with a clear mind and independent.

                <h3>Katherine Wilkie, Robert Wilkie & Mary Barclay <small>(55)</small></h3>
                By 2000, the headstone to this family was badly broken, in 2020 the remaining pieces were placed together but because it could no longer hold the weight of the broken stone, the headstone it now laid down. Robert was a shipping merchant and consul for the government, mentioned in archives kept in record offices today, ie Kew records or Bedfordshire & Luton with correspondence between Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, ambassador at Madrid & Robert. We know from these different records that Robert was consul of Alicant (sic) and Tripoli, Libya. Robert who was the son of Robert & Isobell Wilkie was born in Scoonie, Fife, Scotland circa 1819 and married Katherine Penelope ? An archive from Kew states that Robert was due a salary in 1868, whether this is when he returned to England is unclear. Katherine was living in Lympstone prior to her death in Feb 5th 1791 and Robert aged 72, died shortly after in Dec 3rd 1791. Mary Barclay of Lympstone, daughter of the late Mrs Wilkie was buried Mar 21 1817, aged 70. Mary left a will (available at Devon Heritage Centre, there is also a "Commonplace Book of Mary Barclay 1766" whether this is the same Mary needs checking.

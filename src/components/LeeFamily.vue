        I would like to talk about this chest tomb next [Editors Note: Photo was not submitted alongside article], it's
        the family
        vault to the Lee family.
        Sadly the memorial plaques are in a bad state of repair and I only know of 8 names of the
        deceased buried below, how many more we don't know.
        <br><br>
        The first person buried here was not a Lee but a Robert Yeates, a trustee of Gulliford who died
        in 1779 aged 25 leaving a wife Jenny with sons aged 1 & 2.
        Jenny widowed at the age of 21 was the daughter of Matthew Lee.
        <br><br>
        We mentioned Thomas Lee of Sparkhays as giving the original plot of land for the building of
        Gulliford.
        Sparkhays was between Woodbury Village & Woodmanton but was lost much later in a fire.
        <br><br>
        The family inherited Ebford Barton in 1728 where they continued to live until 1891.
        The Lees obtained a coat of arms in 1759 which can be seen in the parish church at Woodbury.
        The family also lived in St Leonard's, Exeter opposite Larkbeare House, home to the Baring family
        who started the Baring Bank. This is just passed St Leonard's Church where the judges lived & now I
        believe the registry office is. The Lees having made money in farming moved into the woollen trade.
        <br><br>
        Jenny's mother is buried here, she was the daughter of a rich London linen draper and had married
        Matthew Lee
        in 1742.
        Matthew had kept a diary of that time & in it recorded the cost of the marriage as an embroidered
        waistcoat
        &#163;11, an Irish
        silk nightgown for himself &#163;2, a brides diamond ring with 24 stones &#163;16, a pair of 3 drop brilliant
        diamond
        earrings &#163;105.
        In today's money over &#163;12,400 or in 1742 it could have bought 15 horses or paid for a skilled trades
        man to
        work for
        over 1,000 days. He also recorded the cost of drums & fiddles at 5s.
        <br><br>
        The other thing about the widowed Jenny was that having lost Robert, she went on to marry Nathaniel
        Wakeford,
        nothing unusual
        in itself until you know that Jenny's older brother Matthew married Hannah Wakeford and Jenny's
        younger
        brother Thomas Huckell
        married Mary Wakeford, all the Wakefords are from the Andover area, we know that Hannah was an only
        child of
        Joseph, a draper
        and that Mary was the daughter of Brice, also a draper, so maybe they are cousins. Nathaniel remains
        a
        mystery.
        <br><br>
        Thomas Huckell Lee is down as a trustee for Gulliford in 1777, living in St Leonards as a merchant.
        We know he was also the owner of a couple of ships registered in the Port of Exeter which covered
        the whole
        of the Exe. A letter of 1788 shows Thomas trying to sell one of the ships stating it was in the
        Greenland
        trade
        which was the cod trade. It's not surprising he dabbled in this as his good friend Charles Baring
        who was now
        living at Courtlands on the boundary between Exmouth & Lympstone, had at least 16 ships over time.
        Charles &
        his
        wife are buried over there. Thomas & Mary had 12 children, the first 8 children were baptised at
        Topsham with
        the
        last 4 at Gulliford, was this when they moved from Exeter to Ebford? Thomas died in 1822.
        <br><br>
        The last 2 names on the plaques are to Thomas & Mary's son Brice & their daughter Ann. Brice had
        decided on a
        life
        in the army. He didn't marry. As Colonel he served in the Madras Native Infantry & also in the East
        Indies and
        by 1861
        he is a retired Major General living back at Ebford, who's estate covered 106 acres and employed 8
        labourers
        this does
        not include house servants. We are lucky to have a portrait of Brice seated on the right, along side
        his
        brother Major
        George Lee dressed in black and their nephew Col Sir James Jackson standing behind. Brice dies of a
        stroke in
        1871 leaving
        his unmarried sister Ann to continue living at Ebford keeping house as she had for her brother
        whilst he was
        away in the
        army. Ann dies in 1883 of heart disease, with Col Jackson present, as Gulliford is starting to
        decline in
        popularity.

        This was the last of the Lee burials in this vault, however there was one last family link. Jenny
        and Robert's
        son
        Matthew Lee Yeates, the little boy who lost his father when he was just 2. Matthew grow up and
        married, living
        at
        Primrose Cottage, Budleigh Salterton, a cottage we all know as it was to become the museum at
        Budleigh.
        Matthew had made his money setting up the Exmouth & General Devon Bank in Rolle Street. Sadly this
        went
        bankrupt in 1813. Sometime later we find Matthew in the records for Gulliford as a trustee, acting
        as a
        treasurer
        in 1845, he is now the Rev Matthew Lee Yeates of Cullumpton. He dies just 2 years later in Tiverton,
        deciding
        not to
        be buried at Gulliford.

            I would like to talk about this chest tomb next [Editors Note: Photo was not submitted alongside article], it's
            the family
            vault to the Lee family.
            Sadly the memorial plaques are in a bad state of repair and I only know of 8 names of the
            deceased buried below, how many more we don't know.
            <br>
            <br>
            The first person buried here was not a Lee but a Robert Yeates, a trustee of Gulliford who died
            in 1779 aged 25 leaving a wife Jenny with sons aged 1 & 2.
            Jenny widowed at the age of 21 was the daughter of Matthew Lee.
            <br>
            <br>
            We mentioned Thomas Lee of Sparkhays as giving the original plot of land for the building of
            Gulliford.
            Sparkhays was between Woodbury Village & Woodmanton but was lost much later in a fire.
            <br>
            <br>
            The family inherited Ebford Barton in 1728 where they continued to live until 1891.
            The Lees obtained a coat of arms in 1759 which can be seen in the parish church at Woodbury.
            The family also lived in St Leonard's, Exeter opposite Larkbeare House, home to the Baring family
            who started the Baring Bank. This is just passed St Leonard's Church where the judges lived & now I
            believe the registry office is. The Lees having made money in farming moved into the woollen trade.
            <br>
            <br>
            Jenny's mother is buried here, she was the daughter of a rich London linen draper and had married
            Matthew Lee
            in 1742.
            Matthew had kept a diary of that time & in it recorded the cost of the marriage as an embroidered
            waistcoat
            &#163;11, an Irish
            silk nightgown for himself &#163;2, a brides diamond ring with 24 stones &#163;16, a pair of 3 drop brilliant
            diamond
            earrings &#163;105.
            In today's money over &#163;12,400 or in 1742 it could have bought 15 horses or paid for a skilled trades
            man to
            work for
            over 1,000 days. He also recorded the cost of drums & fiddles at 5s.
            <br>
            <br>
            The other thing about the widowed Jenny was that having lost Robert, she went on to marry Nathaniel
            Wakeford,
            nothing unusual
            in itself until you know that Jenny's older brother Matthew married Hannah Wakeford and Jenny's
            younger
            brother Thomas Huckell
            married Mary Wakeford, all the Wakefords are from the Andover area, we know that Hannah was an only
            child of
            Joseph, a draper
            and that Mary was the daughter of Brice, also a draper, so maybe they are cousins. Nathaniel remains
            a
            mystery.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thomas Huckell Lee is down as a trustee for Gulliford in 1777, living in St Leonards as a merchant.
            We know he was also the owner of a couple of ships registered in the Port of Exeter which covered
            the whole
            of the Exe. A letter of 1788 shows Thomas trying to sell one of the ships stating it was in the
            Greenland
            trade
            which was the cod trade. It's not surprising he dabbled in this as his good friend Charles Baring
            who was now
            living at Courtlands on the boundary between Exmouth & Lympstone, had at least 16 ships over time.
            Charles &
            his
            wife are buried over there. Thomas & Mary had 12 children, the first 8 children were baptised at
            Topsham with
            the
            last 4 at Gulliford, was this when they moved from Exeter to Ebford? Thomas died in 1822.
            <br>
            <br>
            The last 2 names on the plaques are to Thomas & Mary's son Brice & their daughter Ann. Brice had
            decided on a
            life
            in the army. He didn't marry. As Colonel he served in the Madras Native Infantry & also in the East
            Indies and
            by 1861
            he is a retired Major General living back at Ebford, who's estate covered 106 acres and employed 8
            labourers
            this does
            not include house servants. We are lucky to have a portrait of Brice seated on the right, along side
            his
            brother Major
            George Lee dressed in black and their nephew Col Sir James Jackson standing behind. Brice dies of a
            stroke in
            1871 leaving
            his unmarried sister Ann to continue living at Ebford keeping house as she had for her brother
            whilst he was
            away in the
            army. Ann dies in 1883 of heart disease, with Col Jackson present, as Gulliford is starting to
            decline in
            popularity.

            This was the last of the Lee burials in this vault, however there was one last family link. Jenny
            and Robert's
            son
            Matthew Lee Yeates, the little boy who lost his father when he was just 2. Matthew grow up and
            married, living
            at
            Primrose Cottage, Budleigh Salterton, a cottage we all know as it was to become the museum at
            Budleigh.
            Matthew had made his money setting up the Exmouth & General Devon Bank in Rolle Street. Sadly this
            went
            bankrupt in 1813. Sometime later we find Matthew in the records for Gulliford as a trustee, acting
            as a
            treasurer
            in 1845, he is now the Rev Matthew Lee Yeates of Cullumpton. He dies just 2 years later in Tiverton,
            deciding
            not to
            be buried at Gulliford.

            Robert Yeates was married to Jenny Lee at Woodbury on Dec 1775, Jenny was 18 at the time. They had 2 sons Matthew Lee Yeates christened at Topsham in 1777 and Robert christened at Gulliford in Dec 1778. Robert sen was on the board of trustees at Gulliford in May 1777.

            <br />
            <br />
            Matthew Lee born 1744, son of Matthew & Jenny Lee. Matthew jr married Hannah Wakeford in Andover in 1767, there may have been a son born & died in 1768, also daughters Hannah & Jane Mary. As Matthew died 1788 and his father Matthew died in 1774, some records are hard to tell apart. Matthew Lee esq of Woodbury was on the board of trustees at Gulliford in 1777, plus a Mr M Lee paid 2s per year at Gulliford for seating for his servants in 1788.
            <br />

            Hannah Lee wife of Matthew Lee of Mount Ebford, was christened in 1746 in Andover to parents Joseph & Hannah (nee Twogood). Hannah was brought up by step mother Mary (nee Steele) and lived with step brother William Steele Wakeford. Hannah was married in East Street Independent Chapel, Andover the same chapel where she had been christened. Hannah died April 22 1818.

            Jane (Jenny) was a daughter of a rich London draper and married Matthew Lee on his return from learning his father's woollen trade in Holland.

The groom's family also paid &pound;5,000 & Jane's family &pound;3,000 toward the marriage. Jane & Matthew return to Ebford Barton once the lease was up for the tenants, upon which money was spent doing up the house & garden including planting nectarines. The couple's children were Matthew (jr) born 1744, Jenny born 1745 - died 1749, Thomas Huckell Lee born 1752 & Jenny born 1757.  Matthew had stayed in touch with the baring family & with John Baring they invested in Benjamin Donn's first detailed map of Devon of which Gulliford was also added. The lee family & the Baring continued their support for Gulliford, however Matthew died the same year as the new second chapel was built at Gulliford in 1774, aged 59. Jane died in 1800 aged 85, out of Matthew & Jane only Jane's name survives on the tomb. Jane Lee had left in her will &pound;100 for the benefit of the minister in 1800. This money was used to buy &pound;163 18s 8d worth of capital stock at 3 per cent, the names of the investors were Thomas H. Lee, Charles Baring & Thomas Smith and the profits were given to the minister.

        <h3>Sarah & Eliza Russell</h3>
        Next to George is Sarah & Eliza Russell, they were aunt & niece, both unmarried,
        both working at Ebford Barton for the Lee family, but George & Sarah and Eliza never met in life.
        <br><br>
        Sarah was born in Clyst St George and Eliza the daughter of a farm labourer John who rose to
        become a blacksmith, was born in Woodbury.
        <br><br>
        Sarah & Eliza worked in the Lee household as servants, under Brice Wakeford Lee.
        In 1851 there was also a James Russell working as a house servant born in Farrington,
        duties would have been footman, valet etc we don't know if he was related but 10 years
        later Mary Russell has joined the household as cook and 12 year old Adam Russell as
        Boy of all Work. James Russell is visiting the Lees as Professor of Music at Oxford and
        John Russell and family are farming nearby at Lower Ebford. So it looks like both families
        looked out for each other.
        <br><br>
        We have no record of what Sarah and Eliza looked like but they would have attended chapel
        here at Gulliford each Sunday with their employer walking through the gateway just as you
        have today. We know from the headstone that Sarah worked for the Lees for 47 years and
        Eliza 37 years. Sarah was 69 when she died in 1870 of asthma & a diseased heart whilst Eliza
        was 47 when she caught T.B and died the same year as Sarah. Employer Brice Lee died the following
        month.
        <br><br>
        I'm sure that the Lee family would have paid for the headstone for Sarah & Eliza, the wording
        they chose such as much esteemed, especially respected, speaks volumes about these 2 women and their
        relation with the Lees which went further than just employer & employee, burying Sarah & Eliza next
        to a
        family member.

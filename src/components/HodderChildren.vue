        The above Hodder children along with their other brothers & sister share three headstones at Gulliford and are by far the saddest family group. They are the children of Samuel and Matilda Hodder, tallow chandlers of Topsham, who had 14 known children out of which Samuel & Matilda buried 8 children in either Topsham or Gulliford. Samuel & Matilda do not have a headstone at Gulliford.
        <br /><br />
        Thomas Bending Hodder is buried at St Margaret's Topsham, 1833-1834, mentioned on the Gulliford headstone.

        Henry Hodder buried Dec 1839, aged 1 year & 7 months, Gulliford.
        <br /><br />
        Frances Kate Hodder 1847 - July 1850, Gulliford.
        <br /><br />
        Amanda Hodder 1855 - 1858, buried Gulliford
        <br /><br />
        The Hodder family had family connections with the Presbyterian chapel in Topsham. In a will of John Bending a deceased tallow chandler he left his grandson Samuel Hodder his business and property in Topsham. Samuel married Hannah Bending at Topsham in 1807. Two years later their son Samuel was born, who continued the trade in Fore Street, Topsham and married Matilda Charlotte Hore in St Sidwell's church, Exeter in 1831. This story is of their children. By 1851 census, the shop as well as selling candles was trading in groceries and earthenware. The family may have used the burial ground at Gulliford due to the lack of space for dissenters at Topsham. Samuel and Matilda both died aged 67, both buried at Gulliford.
